After several attempts to reboot the router  Outpost was contacted and advised of the concern. The router was sent to them  and they are working on repairing or replacing it. Two crew members from the MAU team brought a router that they had in their possession and installed it as a temporary replacement  with the permission of Outpost.,No EVAs were conducted from MDRS today  but crew members drilled in donning and doffing procedures. Suits and radios are all charging after restoration of power  and all systems appear to be operating nominally.,We were still in emergency operations for the first portion of the day  but power was restored with a standby rental generator at approximately 0900. The decision was made to restore power to electrical systems with a staggered ramp up  beginning with radio comms  then suits  rovers  and Internet  and then full load after the SOC was stable above 50%. All systems appear to be operating nominally at this time. Our crew is extremely grateful for the dedicated effort of the Outpost team in restoring power for us.,Please refer to the GreenHab Report,,,No operations today,Please Refer to the Health and Safety Report,We have no specific concerns or requests at this time.

Crew 186  03JAN2018,SOL  03,M. Grande,Generator power system,,,Bad news followed by good news  so hang in re  please. The generator failed sometime this morning  which was pretty spiteful of it. I went out through the engineering airlock to check that it was still running at 4am and at 6am  mostly out of concern for our HSO Biologist s experiment running out in the Science Dome. With a long continuous runtime for the stage of his experiment last night  it was absolutely critical he didn t lose power  so I wanted to keep a sharp eye on those batteries. At 8 40am  however  after a nice morning yoga session with Kshitij and the crew  the generator read  Failure  Under speed  8 12 am Jan 03 . And the  had dropped critically to 35%. We previously believed that the clock on there was not correct  but still  the generator was off for a maximum of 2 40 hrs while everyone was mostly asleep and very little power was being drawn. So I gave those  System batteries a stink eye  because they really quit out on us  dropping like that.,60%,37%,09,,128991.9 Gallons,,Water  loft      Yes,,,Yes,,,,,,Assigned to director only.,5.1,96%,100%,No,Yes,8.7,100%,72%,Yes,No,4.3,100%,,No,No,3.1,100%,,No,Yes,97.4,100%,96%,Yes,,None,No,,,All nominal,All nominal,All nominal,All nominal,All nominal,,Not operational yet,Crew is healthy and well exercised,and requests to Mission
